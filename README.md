# CNN
This repository demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with simple features for image classification and object recognition. The project covers the basics of CNN architecture while utilizing simple feature extraction techniques to improve model performance.

Features:

CNN implementation from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
Feature extraction using edge detection and histogram analysis
Training on small datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom images)
Comparison of CNN performance with traditional machine learning classifiers
Visualization of feature maps and convolutional layers
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, and recall
ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

ðŸ”— Dataset: MNIST, CIFAR-10, or custom datasets

Feel free to explore and contribute! ðŸš€
